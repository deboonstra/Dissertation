# Dissertation: Model Selection for Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs)

## File directories
- `Meeting Notes` contains files related to our meetings to discuss my disseration.
- `References` contains PDF files of previous research in this area.
- `Miscellaneous` contains random files that might be of use.

## Problem areas to explore
- Create an information criteria that is better than QIC by accounting for the within-cluster correlation in the goodness-of-fit term.
- Data drive method to determine the variance estimator to use for inference of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ for GEEs.
